# chrome-extension
A chrome extension to collect/process online news sources for how many dead (HMD).

## Overview

Ultimately HMD needs to process online news articles automatically using ML techniques to identify relevant casualty reports and extract relevant data. In order to do this, we need training data. This chrome extension is a tool to manually capture casualty reports from news sources via Chrome. The idea is to not only extract the casualty data, but also metadata that allows us to identify where elements of the HMD data model are found in a news source. The hope is that collecting this metadata will allow us to train our ML algorithms better.
